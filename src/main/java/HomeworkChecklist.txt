SHORT ANSWERS
    [X] Comment below what the difference between TestNG and the main method is
        // ANSWER HERE:
        // TestNG is a testing framework which executes unit tests for the methods defined in the
        // Calculator class.
        // The main method is in the Calculator class and is used to print some lines to be used for debugging while
        // developing the Calculator class.
        // The difference is that TestNG is separate from the Calculator.java file and performs unit tests while the
        // main method is a part of Calculator.java and can be used for debugging during development.
